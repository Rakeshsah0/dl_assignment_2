# CNN Model Training and Evaluation

## Overview

This project involves training CNN Models and is divided into two different parts.

- **[Part A](https://github.com/Rakeshsah0/dl_assignment_2/tree/main/Part%20A)**:  Train a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune the hyperparameters and visualize filters
- **[Part B](https://github.com/Rakeshsah0/dl_assignment_2/tree/main/Part%20B)**: Finetune a pre-trained model just as you would do in many real-world applications

### Report
The project involves the use of a library called wandb which keeps track of sweeps and generates different graphs. [The report](https://wandb.ai/rakeshsah192837465/dl_assignment_3_cnn/reports/CS6910-Assignment-2--Vmlldzo3NTI0NDk5) is made using wandb as well.
