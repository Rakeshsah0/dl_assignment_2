# CNN Model Training and Evaluation

## Overview

This project involves training CNN Models and is divided into two different parts.

- **[Part A]()**:  Train a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune the hyperparameters and visualize filters
- **[Part B]()**: Finetune a pre-trained model just as you would do in many real-world applications
